# Advent of code 2023

This is a collection of my solutions for the [Advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge.

My goal is to solve the puzzles using different programming languages, and to learn something new along the way.

## Languages used:

- [x] Rust - [Day 1](01/src/main.rs)
- [x] JavaScript _(as a oneliner)_ - [Day 2](02/part2.js)
